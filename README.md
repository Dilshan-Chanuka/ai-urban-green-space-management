# üå≥ AI-Powered Urban Green Space Management System (UGSMS)

## Project Overview

The **Urban Green Space Management System (UGSMS)** is an end-to-end data pipeline designed to analyze environmental, usage, and sentiment data from parks in German cities. Leveraging machine learning models, the system generates **actionable recommendations** for proactive park management, aiming to improve urban green spaces for both the environment and visitors.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Multi-source Data Integration:** Seamlessly combines air quality, visitor footfall, public sentiment (from tweet analysis), and detailed park information.
* **Real-time Data Processing:** Utilizes **Apache Spark** for scalable and efficient data ingestion and processing, handling large datasets with ease.
* **Machine Learning Pipeline:** Implements multiple supervised ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict intervention needs.
* **Delta Lake Storage:** Employs **Delta Lake** for robust data storage, providing ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and data versioning.
* **MLflow Integration:** Ensures comprehensive model tracking, experiment management, and reproducibility for all machine learning workflows.
* **Automated Recommendations:** Generates specific, actionable recommendations tailored to individual park needs based on predictive analytics.
* **Proactive Management:** Enables park managers to anticipate issues and intervene before they escalate, optimizing resource allocation.
* **Data-Driven Decisions:** Empowers management with insights derived from comprehensive data analytics, fostering more effective strategies.

## üí° Project Value

The UGSMS delivers significant value by transforming traditional park management into a proactive, data-driven discipline:

* **Proactive Park Management:** Predict intervention needs (e.g., maintenance, air quality improvements, public engagement campaigns) before issues escalate.
* **Resource Optimization:** Allocate maintenance, personnel, and financial resources more efficiently by targeting areas with the greatest need.
* **Data-Driven Decisions:** Base management strategies on comprehensive analytics, moving beyond guesswork to informed, impactful actions.
* **Environmental & Social Impact:** Improve air quality, enhance visitor experiences, and foster more sustainable and enjoyable urban green spaces.
